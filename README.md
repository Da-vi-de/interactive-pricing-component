### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

Although this is a simple layout, i've never dealt with slider range bars and switch checkboxes, it took me
some time to implement the design correctly.
Afterwards i challenged myself by rewriting JS solution because i was repeating the same code 
(in the beginning i did everything with if/else staments), so i figure out the best way to avoid WET code was 
using switch cases, it wasn't staightforward, nothing was working as expected, eventually i realized the switch couldn't 
read percentage values.

### Continued development

Definetely i need to practice more responsive web design.
